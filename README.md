## **📜 Overview**

This project showcases the implementation of three essential graph algorithms:

- 🟢 **Prim's Algorithm**: Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using an unordered minimum-priority queue.
- 🔵 **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the MST using the Union-Find data structure.
- 🔴 **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Calculates the shortest paths from a single source vertex using a priority queue.

📌 **User Interaction**: The program allows users to select an algorithm through a menu and processes graph data stored in external files.

---

## **✨ Features**

- 📂 Reads graph data from input files (`input1.txt` and `input2.txt`).
- 💡 Implements three fundamental algorithms in graph theory.
- ⏱️ Displays results (edges, weights) and execution times.
- 📊 Supports undirected and weighted graphs.

## **🛠️ How to Run the Project**

### **📋 Prerequisites**

- ☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- 🖥️ A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or a terminal.

### **📖 Steps to Run**

1. 📥 Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. 📑 Place the input files (`input1.txt`, `input2.txt`) in the same directory as the Java source code.
3. 🏃 Compile and run the `cpcs324_group10_pt2.java` file.

### **▶️ Execution**

- 📌 When prompted, select the desired algorithm:
  1️⃣ Prim's Algorithm\
  2️⃣ Kruskal's Algorithm\
  3️⃣ Dijkstra's Algorithm
- 🖊️ Enter any additional input if prompted.
- 📊 Results (edges, weights, execution time) will be displayed in the console.

## **📁 Input Files**

### 📄 **`input1.txt`**

Contains graph data for **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms.\
**Format**:

- Number of vertices
- Number of edges
- Edge data: `source destination weight`

Example:

```
6
10
0 1 3
0 4 6
...
```

### 📄 **`input2.txt`**

Contains graph data for **Dijkstra's** algorithm.\
**Format**: Same as `input1.txt`.

## **📘 Algorithms in Detail**

### 🔹 **Prim's Algorithm**

Finds the MST by starting from a single vertex and expanding the tree with the smallest edge at each step.

### 🔸 **Kruskal's Algorithm**

Finds the MST by sorting edges and adding the smallest edge to the tree, avoiding cycles.

### 🔹 **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

Finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices using a greedy approach.
